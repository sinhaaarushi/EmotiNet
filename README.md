# Idea
*Addressed class imbalance in the FER-2013 dataset by employing image augmentation and class weights, improving model robustness.&nbsp; 

*Designed and iterated on custom CNN models, including advanced architectures such as VGG16 and ResNet50v2, to optimize performance.

*Achieved a 61% overall accuracy on emotion classification, with the final model based on ResNet50v2, detailed through precision, recall, and F1-scores across 7 emotion labels. &nbsp; 

*Deployed the model for real-time emotion detection in live video streams using Gradio and OpenCV, showcasing emotion labels dynamically on-screen.
