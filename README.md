Addressed class imbalance in the FER-2013 dataset by employing image augmentation and class weights, improving model robustness.
Designed and iterated on custom CNN models, including advanced architectures such as VGG16 and ResNet50v2, to optimize performance.
Achieved a 61% overall accuracy on emotion classification, with the final model based on ResNet50v2, detailed through precision, recall, and F1-scores across 7 emotion labels. Deployed the model for real-time emotion detection in live video streams using Gradio and OpenCV, showcasing emotion labels dynamically on-screen.
